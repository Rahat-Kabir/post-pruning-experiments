Using block-level influence scores based on hidden state similarity, we identify and remove the least important layers while maintaining performance on downstream tasks like HellaSwag.\n\nThe workflow includes:\n- Loading and preparing the model\n- Measuring influence of transformer blocks\n- Pruning selected layers\n- Evaluating the pruned model using `lm_eval`\n\nThis notebook provides a reproducible implementation of the pruning pipeline, along with benchmarks to compare model performance before and after pruning.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install datasets
