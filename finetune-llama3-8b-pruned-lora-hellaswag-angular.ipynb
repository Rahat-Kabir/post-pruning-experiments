The pruning process reduces the number of transformer layers to improve efficiency, while LoRA enables efficient parameter tuning with limited resources.\n\nThe workflow includes:\n- Installing required libraries and loading the dataset\n- Initializing the pruned model and tokenizer\n- Applying LoRA configuration for fine-tuning\n- Training the model with Hugging Face's `Trainer`\n- Saving the fine-tuned model for later use\n\nThis project focuses on maintaining performance while reducing computational costs through pruning and parameter-efficient tuning.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install datasets lm_eval
